# To-do

1. Add instructions to this README.md file to setup the project and run it.
2. Multimedia files such as _.mp4_ files must **NOT** be kept in the Github repository. They must always be referenced through an external source such as an External Google Drive Link to each file.
3. Add a **.gitignore** file to exclude bulky files such as **.mp4** to get automatically excluded from the Git repository when the commit is pushed to the remote Github repository.
4. Rename the repository to small case "object-recognition".
5. Remove temporary files such as _.DS_Store_from the repository by placing their name in the **.gitignore** file.
